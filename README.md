## Description

During the refactoring of code, purpose was to make the code more accessiible. By doign this, this allows the webpage to load better with slower interent and also follow a better semantic of code. By refactoring the code and making it more semantic this allows the web page to be found in search engines more easily. Refactoring this code allowed me to work on position of elements, making code more accesible by cleaning up css code and images and also style a webpage into sections rather than using div tags.
